This NPM Package will wrap [HypheX's Trello API Module](https://github.com/HypheX/roblox-trello/tree/v2-dev) in TypeScript for [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.github.io), with the purpose of unlocking this type of functionality to developers without having to fiddle with setting up complicated modules.

It is currently based on the on-development v2 of the module. Version of the package will be related to the version of the module this is based on.

The ultimate goal is to allow the edition of remote boards with ease, abstracting network questions away.
